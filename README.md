Well, basically, one day I was really bored and thought I'd dust off a bit of the html and css knowledge I learned on my own years ago.
In the end one thing led to another and I ended up creating this page that will act as a personal portfolio to showcase my projects, skills, background and so on.
If anyone reads this and has any doubt about how to upload a website to github for hosting and then use a custom domain, send me an email or message and I'll be happy to help you!
